                  <strong>1887</strong> - Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), 
                  a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission

                “Let the future tell the truth and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments.
                The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine.” “The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly,
                but one can think deeply and be quite insane.”
